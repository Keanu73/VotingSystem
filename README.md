# First Election
The first election in the Republic of Keansia on the [SwitchCraft](https://switchcraft.pw) server was held on March 13th, also Ale32bit's birthday, as proposed by him.

### History of the Republic's Politics
On the 25th of February, at around 7:30PM GMT, 3d6, then assumed the Speaker of the House in the Keansian Parliament, held a leader's debate with the 3 key candidates at the time: *Keanu73*, *Ale32bit*, and *gollark*. She asked key questions about each of their agendas and policies, and overall it was clear that all 3 had very similar policies, ideas and ambitions in mind, and wanted to do their best to deliver a full democracy to Keansia and bring about changes. They also informally agreed on a deal to form a Citizen's council, of which Ale32bit, gollark and Keanu73 would be joint consuls regardless of who won the presidency.

On the 7th of March, Ale32bit made a significant decision to quit Keansian politics by quitting the presidential campaign and resigning from his presumed position as a consul. Ale32bit made this decision as he was feeling low and also he claimed that apparently he wouldn't really do anything if he won the presidency for Keansia. Still, he was a respected candidate and opponent, and still is to this day. He will be remembered for his contribution to the Republic, and suggesting notorious reforms that have shaped our Republic today, like concrete roads, and connected-up street signs.

On the 13th of March, the Keansian elections took place. Although the voting system was a bit buggy and a bug was prevalent in Ale32bit's [SwitchChat](https://github.com/Ale32bit/SwitchChat) framework, the votes were counted, although an unreasonably low turnout was done that day, due to the 24-hour length of the election period. In the future, election periods will be held for longer.

## Election Results

These are the following people who turned up to vote that day and a guess of who they voted for. (not in order)
1. Ale32bit - Keanu73
2. HydroNitrogen - Keanu73
3. SolarFlame5 - Keanu73
4. kolya5544 - Keanu73
5. n64c - gollark
6. kepler155c - Keanu73
7. znepb - Keanu73
8. SkyDiverCool - gollark
9. EldidiStroyrr - gollark

Overall, Keanu73 won 6 votes while gollark only won 3.

The election period was honestly quite short, and we will make sure to extend it in the future.

Also, a couple of bugs and enhancements are further required to the voting system.
